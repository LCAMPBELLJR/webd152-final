            <h3>This is Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              How we got started was simple for us, this was our lifestyle for generations. We learned to build yurts from our forefathers. We also inherited the land. We started building yurts for the family. Then for some friends. Hearing about a good thing, news travel fast so we open our land where Forest and Pacific ocean comes together.   Our family always worked and played together.  We grew up in the kitchen, cooking as a family.  There are members in our family who are master chefs who love the art of cooking and the rest of the family enjoy the experience immensely.  We share this experience with our guest at a huge table outdoors every Friday. Family togetherness is the cornerstone of our beliefs and we built our business on those premisses.  It is our goal to continue our family tradition for many generations to come.
